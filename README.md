# ItemSwitch

A simple quality of life plugin that automatically replaces whatever's in your hand after it's been used, runs out, or breaks.

Works with items, potions, buckets, and blocks.

See a demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NsIaW7285c

By default, it's enabled, but can be toggled per-user with `/itemswitch toggle`. Individual events can also be toggled on and off. All defaults are configurable.

Optionally, you can require the `itemswitch.use` permission for the plugin to work.
