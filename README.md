# ItemSwitch

A simple quality of life plugin that automatically replaces whatever's in your hand after it's been used, runs out, or breaks.

Works with items, potions, buckets, and blocks.

By default, it's enabled, but can be toggled per-user with `/itemswitch toggle`. Individual events can also be toggled on and off. All defaults are configurable.

Optionally, you can require the `itemswitch.use` permission for the plugin to work.
